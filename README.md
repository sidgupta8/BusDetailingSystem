# BusDetailingSystem
👉I worked on a Smart IoT based Display System for BUSES. This will display the specific Bus Number(s). with their respective Stops/Areas. The display is “Once feed, Automatically Run” based hence terminates daily works for announcements. For a development in future I'm also planning to send message to all students (which are saved in database), before regular completion of college (15 min.); hence reducing Rush for Bus Details.

Advantages:
👉This System replaces the daily announcement system, which is many time unclear to Students and faculties.
👉Since the display showing the Bus details in a repetitive looping manner, hence students/faculties will never feels rush for listening their Bus Number's.
👉Also, since the system is “Once feed, Automatically run” based hence reducing Human Efforts.
